# DataFest 2025 – Commercial Real Estate Visualization

**Best Visualization Winner – DataFest 2025**  
University of Delaware  
Analyzed trends in U.S. commercial real estate, focusing on Class A office buildings across major cities.

## Overview

Our project explored how rent prices and office availability shifted across urban markets post-2020. Despite rising vacancies, cities like **San Francisco** maintained high rent.

Key tools used:
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Google Colab
- Public commercial real estate datasets

## Visualizations

- Multi-city comparison of rent and availability trends  
- Dual-axis plots showing divergence in San Francisco  
- Industry-specific rent trends over time

## Insights

- San Francisco saw a sharp rise in vacancy while rents held steady
- Tech-heavy markets experienced the steepest occupancy drops
- Even when availability goes up, rents can stay high for a while.
